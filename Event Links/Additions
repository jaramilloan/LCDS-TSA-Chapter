 # For Future Leaders:
 The rules for the High School TSA events change every other year, with it alternating with the middle school events. 
 If you are in charge of the repository 
 (Most likely President or some other Chapter position)
 MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE RULES!
 Everyone in the class will be happier for it.
 THANK YOU!
