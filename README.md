# LCDS-TSA-Chapter
Hi, this is the official repository for the LCDS TSA Chapter. Here you will find all of the resources and projects we have found and developed over the years to help future students.

# Description
TSA involves students in student-led STEM activities, where they have the opportunity to learn
new skills, work with others, and compete against other students across the country.
Throughout the year, students will be researching their own activities, crafting new ideas, and
building skills of collaborations and freedom to work without help. Students will start choosing
which events they want to work on in September, continue to work on them through February.
Students then compete at conferences: regionals, states, and nationals.

# Goals and Objectives
The main goal for students is to be more interested in different facets of STEM and know that
There are many different parts of STEM beyond technology and engineering. In terms of
competing, the goal is to have more than a majority of the students to have placed in the top ten
place for their chosen event at the regional level. For states, the goal is to have at least a few
people in the top ten. For nationals, we just hope people try their best, as this is the hardest
conference of all three.

# Events
Events vary in terms of whether they are completed before the conference or during the
conference and the number of people who students are allowed to work with. Students will choose a minimum of 4 events that require work before the competition. Students may also sign up for 1-3 events that require only time during the conference. All the details relating to every event are posted under modules on the TSA canvas page.

# Committees and Chapter Team
All students have the opportunity to grow their leadership skills with the Committee and Chapter Team positions available. For committees, the main two that will require help will be fundraising and social media management. The fundraising committee will be in charge of raising funds for the club. This will be done through sponsorships and donations, as well as fundraising events. The social media management committee will be in charge of keeping the LCDS TSA instagram up to date. They will make posts of the work that the students have done, interact with other clubs, and try to reach out to members of STSA for possible plans throughout the year. They also will be in charge of closely documenting each conference and the results of each student. Chapter Team is responsible for being the head of each of the previously mentioned roles. The secretary will be responsible for keeping minutes of each meeting. The treasurer will be responsible for where funds come from, how much will be needed, and what they will be spent on. The reporter will be the head of the social media management committee. Lastly, the vice president will be elected as the runner up for the president position for the next year.
